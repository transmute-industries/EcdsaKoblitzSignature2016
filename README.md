# EcdsaKoblitzSignature2016

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/transmute-industries/EcdsaKoblitzSignature2016.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/transmute-industries/EcdsaKoblitzSignature2016)

A minimal implementation of EcdsaKoblitzSignature2016 in javascript.

Mostly to provide clarity around how complex linked data signature suites are, in the hope that future suites will be simpler.
